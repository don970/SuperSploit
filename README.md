SuperSploit is my first attempt at an exploit management system I took inspiration from Metasploit.

Supersploit is a small python program, the program is capable of creating and handling backdoors along with initial exploit connections. The program has a custom obscuration system to hide data being 
sent over the network, a custom handler that acts like a server thus allowing the program to handle 
dozens of connections at one time.

**KEY POINTS**
    * Lightweight
    * Able to run any platform with python3
    * Fully incorprated shell on linux
    * Auto-suggested inputs with history
